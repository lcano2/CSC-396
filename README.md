# Project Pitch
The problem that we identified was users often struggling to meet their habits and goals consistently. We decided that to solve this issue, users can create habits for themselves which they can track on a daily basis by having a tracking system and check-ins. This solution is unique because  it combines habit tracking with personalized progress insights and regular accountability reminders, ensuring users stay motivated and on track toward their goals. 

# Front End 
This project will use SwiftUi build the front end, enabling users to log in and tracking history.

# Back End
This project will use SQL to store user login information and tracking history, with Flask serving as the backend server to manage data.

# Functional Requirements
Users must be able to create an account, sign in, and manage their profile.
Users can create specific goals to track.
Users can receive push notifications for milestones, reminders, and motivational messages. 
Users can view visual progress reports, such as graphs or charts, to track their goal completion over time.


# Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: The system should respond to user actions (e.g., habit creation or progress update) within 2 seconds for 90% of users.
Scalability: The backend must handle up to 100 users without significant performance degradation
Usability: The platform's user interface should achieve a User Satisfaction Score (via surveys or feedback) of at least 85% for ease of use.
Security: All sensitive user data, including payment information, must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption
